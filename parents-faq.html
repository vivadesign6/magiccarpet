                                    <p>The Magic Carpet Journey is Duolingo's interactive language learning experience designed specifically for children aged 5-11. It visualizes your child's language learning progress as a magical carpet that grows more vibrant and detailed as they master new skills. The carpet serves as both a motivational tool and a visual representation of their unique learning path.</p>

                                    <p>Currently, the Magic Carpet Journey supports learning in Spanish, French, Japanese, German, Italian, Chinese, and Portuguese. We're constantly adding new languages based on parent and educator feedback.</p>

                                    <p>Yes! The Magic Carpet Journey adapts to your child's age, learning style, and pace. Younger children (5-7) will experience more visual and audio-based learning with simpler vocabulary, while older children (8-11) will engage with more complex language concepts and reading exercises. The difficulty automatically adjusts based on your child's performance.</p>

                                    <p>We recommend 15-20 minutes of daily practice for optimal language acquisition without overwhelming your child.

                                    <p>Yes! Research confirms that children aged 5-11 can learn languages up to 45% faster than adults due to their enhanced neuroplasticity. Their brains are naturally wired for language acquisition during this critical developmental window. The Magic Carpet Journey leverages this natural advantage through age-appropriate activities designed to maximize this biological learning boost.</p>
